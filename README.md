## Description

This website is just a little place for me to host all the photos I take of the cakes, cookies, rice bowls, and other delicious foods that I make. 

## Contributing

This website piggy-backs off of a Google Photos folder. Thus, it is probably worth noting that I do not work for Google, but I would like to give them a shout out. Hey ;)

## License

For the public link to my Google Photos I would prefer if you asked before using it. Same goes for the photos themselves. 

A general MIT lisences is in effect for the code.
